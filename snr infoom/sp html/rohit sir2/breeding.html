                    <p class="clr-1 p3">A building is a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place. Buildings come in a wide amount of shapes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons. A building typically has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place</p>
    <p class="p3">Buildings serve several needs of society – primarily as shelter from weather and as general living space, to provide privacy, to store belongings and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).</p>
